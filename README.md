# Application of Finite State Machines in Intrusion Detection Systems

This repository contains my research exercise investigating the practical application of Finite State Machines (FSMs) in cybersecurity, specifically within Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). This work was completed as part of the Research Exercise coursework for my First Year Introduction to Compilers module and achieved a grade of 17.2/20 marks.

## Project Overview
As a cybersecurity student, I was fascinated by the theoretical concepts of state machines covered in the compilers module and wanted to explore their real-world applications in my field of study. The opportunity to investigate how FSMs enhance security analysis and threat detection presented an excellent chance to bridge theoretical computer science concepts with practical cybersecurity implementations.

The investigation examines how Finite State Machines improve Intrusion Detection Systems' ability to model and recognise complex attack patterns, transition between security states based on network behavior, and provide systematic approaches to threat detection while balancing accuracy with processing efficiency.

## Research Motivation
This research exercise allowed me to:
- Deepen my understanding of FSM theory beyond compiler design
- Explore the intersection of formal computational models and cybersecurity
- Investigate how academic theory translates into industry security solutions
- Develop skills in academic research and technical writing

## Key Findings
- FSMs provide structured frameworks for representing both normal and malicious network behaviors
- State-based detection offers methodical identification of familiar attack sequences
- Processing efficiency improvements through predefined transitions and rules
- Challenges exist in adaptability to novel attack patterns and maintenance requirements

## Academic Context
- Module: Introduction to Compilers
- Assignment: Research Exercise (Task 5 from a logbook)
- Objective: Investigate practical applications of theoretical concepts (state machines, formal grammars, syntax trees, DAGs)
- Word Count: ~500 words
- Grade Achieved: 17.2/20 marks

## Assessment Criteria:
- Novelty of application example
- Academic presentation and referencing
- Content clarity and use of examples/figures

## Research Significance
This work demonstrates how fundamental computer science theory directly applies to critical cybersecurity challenges. Understanding FSMs in security contexts provides foundation knowledge for Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst roles, intrusion detection system design and implementation, network security monitoring and threat hunting, and automated security response systems.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Academic Research: Literature review and synthesis of cybersecurity research
- Technical Analysis: Understanding of formal computational models in practical contexts
- Written Communication: Clear explanation of complex technical concepts
- Critical Thinking: Evaluation of advantages and limitations of FSM-based approaches

## Future Applications
The knowledge gained from this research directly supports my career goals in cybersecurity, particularly in understanding the theoretical foundations of security tools, analysing detection system architectures, developing more sophisticated threat detection methodologies, and bridging academic theory with industry practice.
